When the authentication fail is continuous

$ git push origin master
remote: invalid credentials
fatal: Authentication failed for '...'

One of commands to check
$ GIT_CURL_VERBOSE=1 git push
...
Host: '...'
Authorization: Basic 'password encoded base64'
...

If 'password encoded base64' is incorrect, input command with admin privilege
$ git config --system --unset credential.helper

then, try again.
If it still doesn't, generate token in your github account setting.
